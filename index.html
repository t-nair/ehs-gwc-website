    <h1>Welcome to the EHS GWC Website!</h1>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We are a chapter of <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, an international organization working to bridge the gender gap within the Computer Science field.</p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Eastlake Girls Who Code's mission is to  reduce stigma and close the gender gap in technology fields, which discourage many women and non-binaries from chasing their passions. Our aim is to create a community and provide opportunities for our members, and you don't need induction requirements to join!</p>
    <p>We host 30 minute meetings every other week on Tuesdays in room c109, bringing together a wonderful community of non-binaries and girls who are passionate about all things tech! Come join us to take a dive and learn more about several intersections of technology, participate in workshops, get chances to listen to knowledgeable guest speakers, and get STEM-related volunteer hours through GWC Jr.! We look forward to seeing you at our next meeting!</p>
    <h2>Community Impact</h2>
    <p>We run a variety of programs that aim to positively impact our community!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GWC Jrs</li>
        <p>Girls Who Code Juniors is an outreach program ran by and for girls interested in coding and Computer Science! Eastlake GWC club members run workshops for girls in grades 4-6 on our club's topics of the month. For example, during a month in which Eastlake GWC members are learning about Human-Computer Interaction, our GWC Junior workshops will explore a topic within that field, deepening our members' understanding while also sharing more about the field with our mentees.</p>
        <li>Inglewood Middle School GWC</li>
        <p>Eastlake GWC partners with our nearby middle school's GWC chapter to have fun bonding and outreach events. Stay tuned for announcements about future events!</p>
